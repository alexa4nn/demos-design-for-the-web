    <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
	<p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the <a href ="engine.html">Analytical Engine</a>. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.</p>

    <p>Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Lady Byron.[2] All Lovelace's half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, were born out of wedlock to other women.[3] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother was anxious about her upbringing and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived <a href="insanity.html">insanity</a>. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.</p>

    <p>Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author <a href="dickens.html">Charles Dickens</a>, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as "poetical science"[4] and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".</p>

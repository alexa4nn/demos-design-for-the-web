    <p>The analytical engine was a proposed digital mechanical general-purpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage.[2][3] It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's difference engine, which was a design for a simpler mechanical calculator.</p>

    <p>The analytical engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[5][6] In other words, the structure of the analytical engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era.[3] The analytical engine is one of the most successful achievements of Charles Babbage</p>

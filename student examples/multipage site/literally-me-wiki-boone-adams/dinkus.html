            in typography, a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks or bullets in
            a horizontal row, i.e.   ∗ ∗ ∗   or   • • •  . the symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an
            intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. this latter use is similar to
            a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. when used
            this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before
            and after the symbol. the dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850.[1][2] historically, the
            dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly
            obsolete.

           the word was coined by an artist on the australian periodical, the bulletin, in the 1920s and is derived from the word dinky.

            a globster or blob is an unidentified organic mass that washes up on the shoreline of an ocean or other body
            of water. a globster is distinguished from a normal beached carcass by being hard to identify, at least by
            initial untrained observers, and by creating controversy as to its identity.

            the term "globster" was coined by ivan t. sanderson in 1962 to describe the tasmanian carcass of 1960, which
            was said to have "no visible eyes, no defined head, and no apparent bone structure." other sources simply
            use the term "blob".

            many globsters have initially been described as resembling gigantic octopuses, though they later turned out
            to be decayed carcasses of whales or large sharks. as with the "chilean blob" of 2003, many are masses of
            whale blubber released from decaying whale corpses. others initially thought to be dead plesiosaurs later
            turned out to be the decayed carcasses of basking sharks. others remain unexplained. giant and colossal
            squid may also explain some globsters, particularly those tentatively identified as monster octopuses.

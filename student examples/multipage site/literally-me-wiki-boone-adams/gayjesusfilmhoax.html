since around 1979, a chain letter has falsely claimed that a film is in the works in which jesus will be
            depicted as gay and involved in a promiscuous swinger lifestyle.[a] born of half-truths regarding the many
            faces of jesus, jens j√∏rgen thorsen's abandoned pornographic film about jesus, the hoax initially implied
            that the film's would-be producer was a magazine that had run a poll about thorsen's plans. the narrative
            has morphed over time to claim that the supposed film is an adaptation of the 1997 play corpus christi,
            which does depict jesus as gay, although not in a sexualized manner.

             many letters have directed recipients to contact the attorney general of illinois to demand a ban of the
            supposed film, peaking at roughly 2,000 letters per week. in 1985, attorney general neil hartigan wrote a
            letter to advice columnist ann landers asking for her help in publicizing the film's nonexistence. entities
            to fall for the hoax in subsequent decades include the county council of pictou county, nova scotia.
            forty-six years after its inception, the hoax persists as of 2025, now spread on facebook. film regulators
            across the globe have received complaints as recently as 2018.

            "nowhere girls" or "mei nü" (chinese: 沒女; pinyin: méi nǚ) is a neologism coined to describe women who have
            no money, employment, education, prospects, looks, friends, or sophistication. the pronunciation of "nowhere
            girls" is homophonic with "beautiful girls" (chinese: 美女; pinyin: měi nǚ) in mandarin chinese.

            the term, which has strong pejorative connotations, is used to characterise women who refuse to conform to
            male expectations and are therefore thought to be unattractive by men. it may be a calque of a south korean
            term, it spread to hong kong via china, and became popularised through its use in a reality show called
            nowhere girls, which was broadcast by television broadcasts limited. this show has aroused much public
            discussion on this topic.

            ol' rip the horned toad (died january 19, 1929) was a texas horned lizard⁠ (phrynosoma cornutum), commonly
            referred to as a "horned toad" or "horny toad", ⁠which supposedly survived a 31-year hibernation as an
            entombed animal following its exhumation from a cornerstone in eastland, texas, on february 18, 1928. the
            lizard became a national celebrity and appeared in 1920s motion pictures. its name was a reference to
            american writer washington irving's fictional character rip van winkle. the same year, a texas political
            delegation led by senator earle mayfield presented the docile lizard to president calvin coolidge at the
            white house for his inspection.

            following the creature's fame, horned toads were sold by the thousands as souvenirs at public events,
            including the 1928 democratic national convention. the ensuing mass capture and export of the horned
            toads resulted in the genus's abrupt decline in west central texas and prompted an intervention by the texas
            department of agriculture.
